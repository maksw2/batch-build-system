# my attempt at a build system. 
it's very limited because windows batch.  
uses g++ and a file list (filelist.txt)  
in the future i want to add options for multiple compilers, building dlls and static libraries,  
configuration files, including filelists from filelists.  
now only existing launch arg is to set final executable name:  
`make.cmd EXEC_NAME` (no extension!!!) (not needed)  
feel free to open issues and prs.  
this is activly maintained.
